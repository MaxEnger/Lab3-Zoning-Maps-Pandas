# Creating Zoning Maps Using Python & Pandas and Displaying the Results in CARTO
The purpose of this lab was to further skills in using Python in Google Colab, while also introducing workflows in Pandas, GeoPandas, and CARTO. Pandas and GeoPandas are important Python tools because they enable users to examine, modify, and model relationships among tabular and geospatial data, respectively. CARTO is a also a useful tool for geospatial professionals because it is multifunctional platform that handles various types of data, which it can further visualize. Additionally, user-generated CARTO products can be published for public accessibility.

### To complete this assignment you will need:


Note that, in the tutorial below, I have included screenshots of what your output should look like. You will not always have the exact same output (especially because you're using the most recent data) but they should give you a sense of what your code should produce. In some cases, your code will simply produce a notifcation that something has run, or the result of a print statement: I have not included screenshots for these.


# Tutorial Citation
This tutorial was originally created by [Nicole Janeway Bills](https://twitter.com/nicole_janeway), who provides a nice [video walkthrough on YouTube here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9G2T4CPYVM&feature=emb_logo). I've changed some of the code slightly to deal with different inputs (Open Data D.C.'s file formatting has changed since the original tutorial); added more background context on the scenario, and added the use of Carto for a final output.
